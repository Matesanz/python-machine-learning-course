    "## 1. Understanding Axes in NumPy\n",
    "\n",
    "An 'axis' in NumPy refers to a dimension of a multi-dimensional array. The axes are defined for arrays with more than one dimension (i.e., matrices, or arrays with 3 or more dimensions). A 2-dimensional array has two axes: the first running vertically downwards across rows (axis 0), and the second running horizontally across columns (axis 1).\n",
